## Abstract
We present new shallow-water records of the magnificent starfish _Luidia magnifica_ (_Asteroidea_: _Paxillosida_: _Luidiidae_) for the Mexican Pacific based on morphological and molecular evidence. The magnificent starfish is a known native in the Philippines, French Polynesia, and the Hawaiian Islands. This study provides morphological variations with the original description and additional habitat information on this species. Also, several species of luidiids starfish larvae were identified based on placement in sister taxon relationships in molecular phylogenies. These larvae were previously submitted to Genbank by another laboratory as unclassified. To investigate biogeographic events among Luidia in general, new visualization techniques were applied to molecular phylogenetic data and geographic metadata. This is the first record of this species in Mexican waters and this discovery extends its distribution to Manzanillo, Colima, Mexico in the Tropical Eastern Pacific. Some morphological differences were found with the original description made by Fisher in 1906, maybe due to differences in size specimens. With the use of molecular techniques, some larvae samples taken on the Caribbean coast of Panama were identified as L. magnifica. Whereby it is possible that species also be introduced in the Caribbean Sea. However, due to their nocturnal habits, adult individuals of this starfish have not been recorded in other areas.
